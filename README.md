# Overview

Hi! Welcome to the repository. This project outlines several basic lighting models implemented in Unity using HLSL (High-Level Shading Language).
Each lighting model is explained with its corresponding mathematical formulation and a breakdown of how it's implemented
in code. If you want to try this out yourself, download the release and run the executable! 

Should you be interested, here is the [link](https://bentobaux.github.io/posts/basic-lighting-models-in-hlsl/) to the project's technical blog post where I explain how each lighting model was implemented in HLSL.
