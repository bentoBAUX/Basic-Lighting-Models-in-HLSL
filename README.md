# Lighting Models in Unity using HLSL

This repository contains several basic lighting models implemented in Unity using HLSL (High-Level Shading Language).
Each lighting model is explained with its corresponding mathematical formulation and a breakdown of how it's implemented
in code.

## Overview

This project demonstrates different lighting techniques used in real-time computer graphics. The models implemented
cover a range from basic diffuse lighting to more advanced techniques like Blinn-Phong and Toon shading.

All shaders are written in HLSL and designed to be used in Unityâ€™s rendering pipeline. Below is an overview of the
implemented lighting models, along with the mathematical concepts and code snippets for each.

## Implemented Lighting Models

### 1. Lambert Lighting

#### Overview

The Lambert lighting model, also known as diffuse lighting, calculates the illumination of a surface by assuming light
is scattered equally in all directions. This is suitable for matte surfaces.

#### Mathematical Formula

\[
I_{\text{diffuse}} = I_{\text{light}} \cdot \max(0, \mathbf{N} \cdot \mathbf{L})
\]
Where:

- \( \mathbf{N} \) is the surface normal
- \( \mathbf{L} \) is the direction of the light source
- \( I_{\text{light}} \) is the intensity of the light

#### Code Snippet

```hlsl
float3 lightDir = normalize(_LightPosition - worldPos);
float NdotL = max(0, dot(normal, lightDir));
float3 diffuse = _LightColor * NdotL;
```

### 2. Gouraud-Phong Lighting

#### Overview

The Lambert lighting model, also known as diffuse lighting, calculates the illumination of a surface by assuming light
is scattered equally in all directions. This is suitable for matte surfaces.

#### Mathematical Formula

\[

\]
Where:

- \( \mathbf{N} \) is the surface normal
- \( \mathbf{L} \) is the direction of the light source
- \( I_{\text{light}} \) is the intensity of the light

#### Code Snippet

```hlsl
